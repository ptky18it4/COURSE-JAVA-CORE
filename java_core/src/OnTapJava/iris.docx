Last Summer, I received a request for help from my friends,
she asked me as a tour guide for her friends while traveling in Phu Yen and I returned to Phu Yen to implement that requirement
I see this trip as a meaningful trip for my summer holidays. I and her friends have visited most of the places in Phu Yen as Mui Dien, B&U Farm, Vung Ro Bay, Mang Lang Church, Da Dia Reef, ... in 3 days.
we spend most of the time to took a photo and ate a lot of specialty food set as Ocean Tuna, Seafood noodle soup,... and a lot of new experiences that until now I had never known before.
After our trip ended, I continued to the coastal city of Nha Trang alone. It was great (  /ɡreɪt/  ), cool climate, beautiful scenery and the people extremely friendly.
In Nha Trang, I spent most of the time to took a photo in places like Ba Ho, Vinperl Land, going to the cinema and finally experience the activities with the people here.

I stayed at Muong Thanh hotel on Tran Phu. I enjoyed this trip because I learned so many new things.
